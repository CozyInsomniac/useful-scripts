# Overview

A collection of small, useful scripts that I sometimes use. Feel free to do whatever you want with them. Each script should be pretty much plug-and-play (Run any given script using `./foo` where `foo` is the script's file name).

# Script Descriptions

This is a list of each script, what it does, and any conditions to run them in. If the **Run Conditions** column is blank, then the script has no special run conditions. 

| File Name         | Function                                                                            | Run Conditions                                         |

| `get-pip-reqs.sh` | List each pip package and its dependencies in the current python environment.       |                                                        |
| `cull-pdfs.sh`    | From the current directory, recursively search for and remove invalid `.pdf` files. | Run within a directory that contains all of your pdfs. |
