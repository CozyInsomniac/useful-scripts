A collection of small, useful scripts that I sometimes use. Feel free to do whatever you want with them. Each script should be pretty much plug-and-play (Run any given script using `./foo` where `foo` is the script's file name).

# Script Descriptions
This is a list of each script, what it does, and any conditions to run them in.
